To test connection between linux local system to the azure devops repo

After performing some changes it working fine. I able to connect azure devops repo to both windows and linux.

Earlier we cause conflict, does again testing to push this latest updated file to both repos.

To test if single command is use to push/pull content to both repos(i.e., github and azure devops repos)

Rechecking the same above thing.
